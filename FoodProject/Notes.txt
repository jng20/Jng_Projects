Food Project

Synopsis
Ever hang out with a group of friends and can't decide what to eat. Or maybe you're alone and don't know what you want to eat.
What if there was a tool that generated a meal for you. What if the tool also tracked what you had in the past few days to
suggests new foods to try. Into cooking? What if the tool could generate recipes too? Customize and personalize the list. Grow the
list over time too.

Potential web 3 app? Sweatcoin but foodcoin???
partner with restaurants. Users generate coins when they use app. coins can be used to buy discounts for food.
promo restaurants too

Goals for now:
1.Design a tool that generates random foods
  -Probably uses a queue to "pop" out food. After popped gets added back to the end of the list.
  -Maybe a randomizer method to randomize the queue but probably not needed.
  -Need an add method. Probably just use queue add.
  -Need a counter and a method that suggests a new food or cuisine not in the list
    -when counter hits certain number the method is triggered
  -Need to take in inputs(food) from user. For now read in inputs.

  Improvements
  -Easier ui. Maybe buttons for the user to add food instead of typing it. some sort of autosuggest
  -Figure out what objects go in the queue.
  -Potentially design an object for foods that go into the queue.
