Food Project

Synopsis
Ever hang out with a group of friends and can't decide what to eat. Or maybe you're alone and don't know what you want to eat.
What if there was a tool that generated a meal for you?
What if the tool also tracked what you had in the past few days to suggests new foods to try?
Maybe you're the adventurous type and you just like trying new things.
Into cooking? What if the tool could generate recipes too? Or at least link you to recipes online.
Help you find the best restaurants around you for the food you're looking for.
Customize and personalize the list. Grow the list over time too.

Potential web 3 app? Sweatcoin but foodcoin???
partner with restaurants. Users generate coins when they use app. coins can be used to buy discounts for food.
promo restaurants too

*Side note*
People like collecting stuff so maybe have like nft collections of food.

Goals for now:
1.Design a tool that generates random foods
  -Probably uses a queue to "pop" out food. After popped gets added back to the end of the list.
  -Maybe a randomizer method to randomize the queue but probably not needed.
  -Need an add method. Probably just use queue add.
  -Need a counter and a method that suggests a new food or cuisine not in the list
    -when counter hits certain number the method is triggered
  -Need to take in inputs(food) from user. For now read in inputs.

  Improvements
  -Easier ui. Maybe buttons for the user to add food instead of typing it. some sort of autosuggest
  -Figure out what objects go in the queue.
  -Potentially design an object for foods that go into the queue.


V1
- created a queue.
- created:
          add(String) returns void - add foods to the list
          pop() returns string - removes food from front of list and places at the back

V2
/*
v2 will increase the food selections available using 100 most popular foods https://www.tasteatlas.com/100-most-popular-foods-in-the-world
Create a randomizer method that selects 10 foods out of the hundred and adds to the list for a base list.
Create a remove method that removes from food list and adds back to top100

Next Steps
    -Still need to think of when to randomly suggest a new addition to the list
    -Still need a way to suggest a new type of cuisine
    -Need a way to classify cuisine because sometimes you want a meal but this list may generate a dessert.
    -Potentially (even though it feels rather inefficient) create an object for each and every food with attributes of
        - name
        - cuisine type
        - meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, dessert)
        - recipe / recipe link
        - nearby restaurants
    - need to figure out way to connect java program to internet.
    - create another save list for new foods to try but don't want to eat at the moment
